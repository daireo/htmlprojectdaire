            <div class="section" id="section4"><h1>Cloud Computing</h1> In cloud computing, the word "cloud" is used as a metaphor for "the Internet," 
            so the phrase cloud computing means a type of Internet-based computing, where different services —including servers, storage and applications — 
            are delivered to an organization's computers and devices through the Internet. <br>

        	<div class="section" id="section5">Cloud computing networks are large groups of servers and cloud service providers that usually take advantage of 
        	low-cost computing technology, with specialized connections to spread data-processing chores across them. This shared IT infrastructure contains 
        	large pools of systems that are linked together. Virtualization techniques are often used to maximize the power of cloud computing.<br>

        	<div class="section" id="section6">Now we all have PCs on our desks, we're used to having complete control over our computer systems—and complete
        	responsibility for them as well. Cloud computing changes all that. It comes in two basic flavors, public and private, which are the cloud equivalents
        	of the Internet and Intranets. Web-based email and free services like the ones Google provides are the most familiar examples of public clouds. 
        	Private cloud computing works in much the same way but you access the resources you use through secure network connections, much like
        	an Intranet. Companies such as Amazon let you use their publicly accessible cloud to make your own secure private cloud, known as a Virtual Private
        	Cloud (VPC), using virtual private network (VPN) connections.<br>
